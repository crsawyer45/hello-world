Hello World!!

My name is Colin Sawyer and this is my github account.
A little about me:

I am a Clemson student pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Biological Sciences.
I am from Orlando, Florida and love the warm weather there; however I also look forward to any opportunity
that allows me to go snowboarding or skiing in the winter.  Travelling the world is my thing as I have been
to close to thirty different countries in my lifetime and am eager for the experiences that others offer when I
get the chance to visit them.
