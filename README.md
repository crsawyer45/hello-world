intro repo to github

Hello World!!

My name is Colin Sawyer and this is my github account.
A little about me:

I am a Clemson student pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Biological Sciences.
I am from Orlando, Florida and love the warm weather, but I also like to be somewhere with snow in the winter so I can ski or snowboard.
My favorite things to do include travelling, outside sports, watching great movies, playing video games, and reading an excellent book.

My GitHub contains handful of the coding problems I've worked on that I found fun or interesting to think about.  They all have README files about how they work and what they do.

Thanks!
