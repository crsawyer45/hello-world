intro repo to github

Hello World!!

My name is Colin Sawyer and this is my github account.
A little about me:

I am a Clemson student pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Biological Sciences.
I am from Orlando, Florida and love the warm weather, but I also like to be somewhere with snow in the winter so I can ski or snowboard.
My favorite things to do include travelling, outside sports, watching great movies, playing video games, and reading an excellent book.

My GitHub contains just a handful of the coding problems I've worked on that I found fun to think about or had interesting algorithms
at play.  They all have README files about how they work and what they do.

Thanks!
